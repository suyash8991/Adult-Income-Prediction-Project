# Adult Income Prediction Project

## Overview
This project analyzes the Adult Income Dataset to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on census data. The analysis focuses on addressing three key machine learning challenges: class imbalance, missing values, and outliers.

## Dataset Description
The Adult Income Dataset contains census data with the following features:
- Demographic attributes (age, gender, race, native country)
- Educational information (education level, educational-num)
- Employment details (workclass, occupation, hours-per-week)
- Financial indicators (capital-gain, capital-loss)
- Target variable: income >50K (binary classification)

Total records: 43,957
